This project is a simple banking management system made with Java. It's got a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing, a Java library for creating desktop applications.

When you run the program, a window pops up asking you to enter a PIN. If you enter the correct PIN (which is set as "1234" in this example), it opens another window showing different banking options: withdraw, deposit, check balance, and inquire balance.

You can click on these options to perform different banking transactions. For example, if you click "Withdraw," it asks you how much money you want to withdraw. If you have enough money in your account, it processes the withdrawal and shows you a receipt.

Similarly, you can deposit money, check your balance, or inquire about your balance. Each action opens a new window with a receipt showing the result of the transaction.

Overall, it's a basic program demonstrating how to create a simple banking system with a graphical interface using Java.
